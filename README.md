# Creative Reservation System

A Flutter Application integrating Google Maps, Places Autocomplete, and Geolocator with these packages is made possible to develop our Creative Reservation System App

## Getting Started

You will need to have a Google project, enable the Android SDK, IOS SDK, and Places API in your GCloud Console.

Obtain an API key and replace the YOUR_KEY placeholders in 
- ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- lib/services/places_service.dart
